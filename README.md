# Smart-City-Simulation
[![Python & Raspberry Pi](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python,rpi)](https://skillicons.dev)

This repository hosts two interconnected projects: a Python/Pygame simulation that visualizes smart city traffic and lighting logic, and a Raspberry Pi hardware setup demonstrating physical streetlight control via LDR and IR sensors.

This repository hosts two distinct, yet conceptually related, projects that explore smart city concepts:
    **Smart City Simulation:** A visual, interactive environment built with Pygame, demonstrating intelligent traffic and street light control.
    **Raspberry Pi Streetlight Controller:** A physical hardware project that uses a Raspberry Pi to control real LEDs based on light levels and object detection.
While the simulation and the hardware controller operate independently, they both showcase principles of intelligent infrastructure, making them a great combined resource for learning and demonstrating IoT and smart systems.

# üåü Project Overview
  **1. Smart City Simulation (Software)**
          This is an **interactive Pygame application** that simulates a smart city road with dynamic elements:\n
          **Real-time Visuals:** See cars moving, sensors activating, and both streetlights and traffic lights changing dynamically.\n
          **Intelligent Traffic Management:** Traffic lights respond to car density, adjusting their state (Red, Yellow, Green) based on how many vehicles are detected at an intersection.
          **Dynamic Streetlights:** Simulated streetlights illuminate based on ambient light conditions (toggleable from the GUI) and the presence of cars near their sensors.
          **Interactive Controls:** Easily add new cars to the road or toggle "day/night" mode directly within the simulation, observing instant changes.
          **Central Broker System:** A dedicated Python server (broker.py) acts as the communication hub, managing the simulation's state and facilitating interaction between the client and its internal logic.
  **2. Raspberry Pi Streetlight Controller (Hardware)**
        This is a **physical project designed to run on a Raspberry Pi**, demonstrating real-world hardware control:
        **Physical Streetlights:** Control actual LEDs connected to your Raspberry Pi.
        **LDR Light Sensing:** Uses a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to detect ambient light levels (day or night).
        **IR Sensor Detection:** Employs IR sensors to detect physical objects (e.g., a hand, a toy car), mimicking vehicle presence.
        **Intelligent Activation:** LEDs (streetlights) turn on only when it's dark (LDR detects low light) AND an object is detected by a corresponding IR sensor.
        **Standalone Operation:** This script (mpca.py) operates independently on the Raspberry Pi, directly interfacing with the GPIO pins to control the hardware based on local sensor readings.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Component Breakdown)
   **Smart City Simulation**
   
     broker.py (The Simulation Brain):
      This script launches a TCP socket server. It's the central repository for all simulation data: car positions, sensor states, simulated LDR values, and traffic light states. It processes commands from the          client.py (like moving cars or toggling day/night) and then calculates the appropriate responses for the simulated streetlights and traffic lights based on its internal logic. This data is then sent back to       the client for visualization.
    
    client.py (The Interactive Visualizer):
      This Pygame application connects to broker.py. It fetches the latest simulation state from the broker and renders it graphically. Your interactions (dragging cars, clicking buttons) send commands to the           broker, creating a dynamic feedback loop.
    
    Raspberry Pi Streetlight Controller
      mpca.py (The Hardware Interface): This script is designed specifically for your Raspberry Pi. It directly accesses GPIO pins to read data from your connected LDR and IR sensors. Based on the real-time             inputs from these physical components, it then controls the connected LEDs. The logic here mirrors the streetlight behavior of the simulation: lights activate when it's dark and an object is detected by an        IR sensor.
